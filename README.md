# 42-libasm
Libasm is a project focused on learning assembly language by rewriting common C functions like strlen, strcpy, and strcmp in 64-bit ASM, emphasizing proper error handling and using Intel syntax. Bonus tasks include implementing additional functions like ft_atoi_base and working with linked lists.
